    <string name="protein_info">Eating protein is crucial for bulking up because it provides the building blocks that our bodies need to repair and grow muscle tissue.\n\nWhen we lift weights or engage in other types of resistance training, we create tiny tears in our muscle fibers.\n\nOur bodies then use protein to rebuild and strengthen those fibers, which leads to muscle growth over time.\n\nWithout sufficient protein intake, our bodies cannot effectively repair and grow muscle tissue, which can limit our ability to gain size and strength.</string>
